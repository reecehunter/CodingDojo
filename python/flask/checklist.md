`Steps we need to take to make a hello world application`

1. Create a folder for our current assignment/project
2. Go into the folder
3. Create a virtual environment with the correct dependencies
```
python -m pipenv install flask
```
4. `WARNING`: Check and make sure we have \_\_pipfile\_\_ and \_\_pipfile.loc\_\_. If we don't have these then we need to fix it now!
